# Flask Test Project

This is a simple Flask project created specifically to test the [deploy_agent.py](file:///D:/programs/Python/Ollama/deploy_agent.py) script.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main Flask application
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This file

## How to Test

1. Navigate to this directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the deploy agent script from the parent directory:
   ```
   python deploy_agent.py
   ```

The script should detect this as a "python-flask" project type and recommend appropriate hosting platforms.
